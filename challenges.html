    <h2>Challenges of Urban Food Security</h2>

    <ul class="challenges-list">
      <li>Higher food prices due to transportation costs, less competition among retailers, and higher land prices.</li>
      <li>Food deserts: areas lacking access to affordable and nutritious food, with few or no grocery stores, farmers' markets, or fresh produce options.</li>
      <li>Low wages, unemployment, and underemployment contributing to financial instability and food insecurity.</li>
      <li>Income inequality limiting access to healthy food for some residents.</li>
      <li>Lack of knowledge about healthy eating habits, meal planning, and cooking skills, leading to reliance on processed foods.</li>
      <li>Limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables in some grocery stores.</li>
      <li>Food waste: large quantities of food discarded by households, restaurants, and retailers, representing lost resources and environmental problems.</li>
    </ul>
