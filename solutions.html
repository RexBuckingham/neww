    <h2>What can we do? </h2>

    <ul class="challenges-list">
      <li>Addressing urban food security is a multifaceted challenge that requires a combination of policies, programs, and initiatives aimed at ensuring all residents have access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food.Encouraging urban agriculture initiatives such as community gardens, rooftop gardens, and urban farms can help increase local food production and provide fresh produce to urban residents. This can also create opportunities for community engagement, education, and job creation.</li>
      <li>Enhancing the distribution of food within urban areas, which encompasses the establishment of farmers' markets, food cooperatives, and mobile markets, represents a pivotal step towards bolstering access to fresh and nutritious food, especially in regions designated as food deserts where conventional grocery stores are scarce. Concurrently, backing local farmers and food producers through initiatives like preferential purchasing programs aimed at local institutions, delivering technical support, and allocating resources to enhance food processing and storage infrastructure, serves to fortify local food systems and diminish reliance on distant food supply chains.</li>
      <li>To combat food insecurity, inclusive collaboration is crucial! Food policy councils unite government, communities, farmers, and advocates to devise tailored solutions. By pinpointing local challenges and crafting effective policies, these councils directly address community needs,empowering residents, especially in low-income areas, with nutrition education and cooking skills training is transformative. Imagine families making informed food choices, stretching their budgets, and maximizing nutrition. Combined with improved food access, this fosters a healthier, food-secure future for all.</li>
      <li>Let's combat both food waste and hunger simultaneously! By implementing smart strategies like food recovery programs and donation incentives, we divert surplus food to those in need instead of landfills, benefiting both the environment and our communities. Additionally, strengthening social safety nets through programs like SNAP and WIC, alongside affordable housing and living wage policies, addresses the root causes of food insecurity â€“ poverty and limited resources. This dual approach ensures a future where everyone has access to nutritious food.</li>
      <li>Building food-secure cities begins with strategic planning. Zoning regulations that prioritize grocery stores in underserved regions and mixed-use developments with designated food retail spaces guarantee access to fresh produce for all. However, planning isn't unilateral. By engaging directly with communities, understanding their unique challenges, priorities, and preferred solutions, we can design programs that genuinely meet their needs. This approach empowers residents, fosters collaboration, and constructs a more fair and resilient food system, one step at a time.</li>
      <li>Creating a future where no resident faces hunger requires a data-driven approach. Research on food insecurity trends, root causes, and solution effectiveness empowers informed policy decisions and targeted resource allocation. Collaboration across local, regional, and national levels, involving community leaders and policymakers, is essential. Together, through urban planning, community engagement, food waste reduction, and social safety net strengthening, we can build a more equitable and food-secure urban landscape.</li>
